    "text": "A powerful component of GIS is the ability to visualize spatial data and interact directly with it’s visual representation. In this section, we’ll look at tools for interacting with spatial data, including changing our view of it,\n\nZooming, panning, and selecting\n\nTry to click and hold, and drag the map window. This will pan, or move the visible window around.\nIn the Map ribbon, try zooming with the Fixed Zoom In/Fixed Zoom Out buttons. If your mouse has a scroll wheel, you can use the wheel to zoom in and out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also zoom by holding the Z key while holding down the mouse button and moving the mouse. If you want to use zoom in using a rectangle, press and hold the Shift key while drawing a rectangle. This will zoom the window to that rectangle (or its nearest approximation scaling the window dimensions).\nClick on the Go Back to Previous Extent button. This returns you to the last view you were using. This is very useful if you accidentally pan or zoom from a location where you are working.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the Full Extent button. This takes you back out to the full extent of the features currently in the Table of Contents. This is very useful if you need to zoom or pan to a new location quickly, or if you lose track of where you are while panning and zooming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also zoom in on a feature of interest. First, click the Select button, then click on Iceland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIceland will appear with a blue outline. This indicates that this polygon has been selected. Now click on Zoom to Selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now see Iceland take up most of the view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen objects are selected, any analyses or edits are only conducted with the selected data. If you look at the dropdown menu under the Select button, you will see additional options for drawing your selection: polygon, lasso (freehand), circle, or line. You can remove a selection with the Clear button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing and using attribute data\nSpatial data associates locations with other data about those places. This additional data is stored as an attribute table.\n\nClick on the Explore button, and then click on one of the features from the countries dataset in the map window. A window should pop up, providing location and attribute data from that feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the catalog pane, add the quakes shapefile. This is earthquake data obtained from the US Geological Survey. It should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see some or all of the quakes layer, it may be hidden underneath the countries layer or the basemap layers. The layers in the map window are drawn in the order they appear in the Table of Contents. Make sure that the quakes layer is positioned at the top of the drawing order in the Table of Contents; if not, click the layer and drag it to the top.\nRight click on the quakes layer and select Open Attribute Table. The data is now presented in a pane at the bottom of the screen, only in table form. Here you can see each point as a row with its associated data. Each column is called a “Field”, and are filled data: OBJECTID (a unique ID for the record), Shape (which tells us what kind of data it is), the time of the quake, latitude, longitude, depth, magnitude (mag), the method used to estimate magnitude (magType), and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the left of each row is a grey box. Try clicking one of these; it should highlight the row, as well as the associated point on the map. This serves the same function as the Select tool we saw earlier when we selected Iceland. You can select more than one row by holding down the Ctrl button while you click, or Shift to select several successive entries.\nAt the top of the table, click the Clear Selection button.This will eliminate the selection you’ve made so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther buttons here give you additional options. For example, the Select By Attribute button allows you to select only those data that meet a particular criteria. You can construct a query based on the fields (columns) in the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, let’s say you wanted to examine only those with a magnitude greater than 7. To do this, in the box that starts with Where, select mag field. This will give you additional options, to which you will modify so that the expression reads “Where mag is greater than 7”. Clicking Apply will select only those features with a mag value greater than 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry a couple of other queries, and then clear the selection when you are finished.\nSwitch Selection inverts the selection according to whatever is presently selected. For example, try selecting quakes greater than magnitude 7 again. Now if you click on Switch Selection, only those less than or equal to 7 will be selected. Be sure to clear your selections when you’re done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Field adds a new attribute field to the data. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three lines button provides additional options for working with attributes. In particular, the Export option will let you export the data as a table object (e.g., CSV file).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, try right clicking on the heading of the depth column. You’ll notice that when you do this, you get a few additional options. Sort Ascending and Sort Descending are self-explanatory, and are helpful for quickly sorting data. You can get rid of an unneeded field by clicking Delete Field.\nPossibly one of the more useful options here is Calculate Field,which can be used to perform mathematical or logical operations on the data.\n\nFor example, each of the quakes has a magError attribute, which tells us the standard error on the magnitude estimate out to one standard deviation. Let’s say we wanted an attribute which would tell us the maximum magnitude within the error range, or the how big the earthquakes could have been. To get this, we would need to add the error to the magnitude estimate. First click Add Field. This brings up a new interface to add fields, with a new entry at the bottom. Call the field maxMag and select the Float data type (which is short for floating-point number, and for our purposes means it will hold a decimal value), then click X. When it asks if you would like to save the results, click Save.\n\nA new field called maxMag should appear at the right side of the table. Right click on the heading for the maxMag field and select Calculate Field.  A window like this should appear:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Fields pane, you’ll see the current attribute fields for the feature. In the right hand pane are some mathematical functions (for instance, Abs( ) is absolute value), including the arithmetic operators as buttons at the bottom. You can calculate new values by building an expression with these options.\nDouble click on the mag field heading, which then populates the bottom pane with that term surround by exclamation marks, e.g. !mag!. Then click the addition symbol + to add this to the expression. Finally, double click on magError and add that to the equation. The final product should look like maxMag = !mag! + !magError!\nPush OK. The result should be a new field with the maximum magnitude out to one standard deviation for each entry in the table.",

    "text": "While the data have attributes which tell us information, the layers have properties which determine things like how the layer should look, what data it may be related to, the source of the data, etc. Here, we’ll learn how to make changes to those properties to see patterns in our data more clearly.\n\nChanging layer properties\n\nSave your work again. Right click on the countries layer in the Table of Contents and select Symbology. A new pane should open at the right side of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext to the Symbol heading, you can see a box that shows the polygons in the countries layer are drawn as green with a grey outline (this may be a different color for you, ArcGIS Pro chooses a random color for each layer when it is added). Click the box, and another pane appears where you can change the color and outline. Select the Properties option to have full control over the choice of color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry selecting a different color for the fill or outline. Click OK. Your changes should appear in the Map Window and Table of Contents:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we’ll use the attribute data to change the look of the map. Click on the Back button in the Symbology pane. Click the dropdown menu where it says Single Symbol. You’ll have a few options here. Select Graduated colors. This will change the appearance of the map so that the colors are based on one of the fields in the dataset, and give you several additional options to modify the settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the Field menu and select POP_EST, which gives a population estimate for each country based on census data. The window below should now be populated with population values and corresponding colors:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe range of populations has been divided up into different bins (0 - 20,107,509, 20,107,510-68,414,136, etc.). These may seem like pretty random numbers, but ArcGIS used an algorithm to divide up the data in such a way as to minimize variability between groups. For now let’s keep the defaults there. Under Color Scheme, scroll down and select the “Greens” palette (gradient from white to green)- Click OK. Now the map should look something like the image below. Each country is now shaded according to its population estimate, and the map is now conveying spatial information. This is an example of a choropleth map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the quakes layer in the Table of Contents, and the Symbology pane should now shift to that layer. Select the Symbol and change the color to a bright red. Click the back button to return to the previous menu.\nAt the top of the pane, select Vary symbology by attribute button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand the Size heading. For Field, select the mag attribute, and then tick the box next to Enable size range. This will change the sizes of your points quite dramatically. Set the Maximum here to 24 pt. Finally, scroll to the bottom and select Show Legend. The result should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the quake data has been plotted as circles, and each circle is given a size according to the magnitude of the earthquake. This map is now giving us data about the distribution of earthquakes of different sizes relative to the distribution of populous countries.\nWhile this is informative, it is a little messy looking. Many of the circles overlap, and the outlines of each circle are drawn over one another. Go back Symbology of the quakes layer and select the Symbol. Here we can get rid of the outlines from the circles by selecting No color under Outline color, then clicking Apply.\nFinally, in the ribbon at top, select Feature Layer. This is a ribbon with options that apply to the feature selected in the Table of Contents. Where it says Transparency, change the value from 0 to 50%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a much cleaner map, and gives a lot of the information we want. However, some things are not as clear. For example, while there is less mess with overlapping circles, the relative numbers of small and large earthquakes in a given location is not as visible. Making maps is often involves trade-offs between the amount of information and the clarity with which that information is communicated.\nBe sure to save your work!\n\n\n\nExporting a map\nNow we’ll take a few last steps to turn what we’ve created into a map we can save and use in a report.\n\nGo to the Insert ribbon and click the New Layout button. This will give you options for a print layout size. Choose ANSI Landscape – Letter. This will bring up a blank document where you can build your map document.\nChoose Map Frame and select Default Extent. You can then stretch a rectangle on the document where you want the map to go.\nClick on North Arrow and select a north arrow that you think would look good here. Add it to the map by clicking and dragging it, adjusting its size and position as needed.\nClick on Scale Bar and follow the same routine to put a scale bar on your map.\nFinally, click on Legend. Choose the first option and then click and drag to create . You may need to resize it in order to get it to fit on your screen.\nTo export your document, go to the Share ribbon and select Export Layout. There are a few different options here; for now, go with Flattened PDF. In the pane at right, accept the default settings and click Export. The document will then be exported into your project folder.",

    "text": "Starting a new session in ArcGIS Pro\n\nSelect ArcGIS Pro from the Windows start menu, then select Map.\nWhen prompted to Create a New Project, give it the name ENV120_GIS1 and be sure to save it somewhere where you will be able to access it again (Box Drive, etc).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now see the ArcGIS Pro interface. Notice when you move the mouse around the screen, there are numbers at the bottom of the screen that are changing. These are keeping track of the position of your mouse cursor on the screen. Currently, these positions are in decimal degrees longitude (E-W) and latitude (N-S) using the WGS 84 Web Mercator datum.\n\nDownload the Lab_1.gdb file from Canvas and save it to the ENV120_GIS1 folder. This is a geodatabase file, which contains spatial data as well as metadata.\n\n\n\nNavigating ArcGIS Pro\nThe main ArcGIS Pro interface contains four principal elements (see image below): ribbon menus, project catalog, table of contents, and the map window.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ribbon menus are like those in other Windows-based applications, and include Project, Map, Insert, Analysis, View, Edit, Imagery, Share, and Help. Many common file operations, such as Open and Save, are under the Project menu. Likewise, functions like Copy, Cut, Paste, and Select All are in the Edit menu. You can also use this menu to modify spatial data.\nThe View menu presents options to revise the tools and menus visible in ArcGIS Pro, and some options for viewing the data from different perspectives:\n\nTry clicking on the X in the top right corner of the Table of Contents, which will close this pane. To get it back, click the Contents button in the View ribbon menu.\nTry clicking on the Geoprocessing button. That should change the appearance of Catalog Pane. This menu has a range of tools to automate different analytical and data management activities.\nClick on the Toolboxes option at the top of the pane. Try expanding the Analysis Tools toolbox. There are five toolsets within the toolbox: Extract, Overlay, Pairwise Overlay, Proximity, and Statistics. These are tools used for doing basic analysis techniques on vector data. You can read more about them here: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/analysis/an-overview-of-the-analysis-toolbox.htm\nClick on the Catalog Pane button in the View ribbon to return to this option.\n\n\n\nAdding data to an ArcGIS Pro session\nSpatial data used in the project will appear in Table of Contents. The project starts automatically populated with two basemaps. These use data that come from image tiles at different zoom levels, hosted on an ESRI server and loaded via the internet. One (World Topographic Map) provides a general view of terrain, borders, and places; the other (World Hillshade) provides hillshade, or shading that gives a sense of vertical relief.\n\nTry turning these on and off by clicking the tick box next to them in the Table of Contents.\n\nNext, we’ll try loading some of our own data into the project.\n\nIn the Catalog Pane, expand the Folders folder, and then expand the ENV120_GIS1 folder. This is the folder for the project you created earlier. You should also see the Lab_1.gdb file. Expand this and you should see two datasets: countries and quakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe countries dataset is based on data from naturalearth.com, containing polygon data (a form of vector data) representing the borders of the countries of the world. Right-click on this dataset. Select Add to Current Map. You should see an image of this appear in the map data window (probably in a different color than that pictured below). You should also see this appear under the Drawing Order heading in the Table of Contents. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe principal mechanism for all GIS analysis is the overlaying of geographic data. Layers are added individually, and can be made to interact by way of their topology (e.g., Do they overlap? Are they touching? etc.).\nKeep in mind that the layer is not the data file itself: it is an instance of that data held in the working memory of the computer for you to interact with in ArcGIS Pro. Think of it like a document in Microsoft Word or another document editor. You can edit the file, but the changes are only committed to the data file once you save it. If you make changes to a layer, it will only change the file after you save the changes. With that in mind, it’s probably good to note that there are Undo (left) and Redo (right) buttons at the very top of the screen:\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, if you want to remove a layer from your current project, right click on the layer you want to remove and select Remove.\nWhen working on a project in ArcGIS, you should save your work frequently. The Save option is located in the Project ribbon.",
